# Setting up an ESLINT AND PRETTIER

 * Make sure to have prettier installed on your dev dependencies, also Eslint

npm install prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier --dev
npm install eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin --dev

 * For prettier you need to include a prettierrc file with your rules
 * For eslint you need to add a .eslintrc.js config file on the root of the project
